    <h2>Success Criteria</h2>
    <p>In order to make my webpage a success the following requirements must be met….

After doing some research, according to Avatar New York, some of the elements that make a webpage interactive and a success include…
“Updating content regulary” :  This means that every time that the World Health Orginization updates their page and there is new data, my page will be updated because it is synced with the World Health Orginazation and observing the data every day
“Encouraging user interactions” : To incorporate this into my site, I will make included the map with the data appearing in on the selected country so that the user will be able to interact with my site and stay on the site sustained amount of time
As another part of my research I have analyzed similar design of sites like the CNN, BBC, and the Finacial Post, which are all very popular and distinguished websites, and make some conclusions regarding simularities
Simularity #1 - Navagation Bar:  In all of these websites, there is a navigation bar across the top with a variety of menus and places of acess to the site.  I would incorporate this in my site by using, CSS and making the colour a dodger blue
Simularity #2 - Sticky Social Bar:  Allthough there is a bit of variety of this element in these sites, there is always a social media bar made by usign CSS.  I will incorporate this in my site, by including the World Health Orginization profiles as well as my GitHub profile listed on the side of my homepage.  This will give more power to the user and provide them with more information regarding the data of the site and the code behind it
Simularity #3 - Delivering Information is a column like format: Lastly, Regarding this element there is diversity, but the use of the column format delivers the information in a clean adn effective way.  In order to incorporate this in my site, I will provide any textual information in that format.
Aside from the research and conclusions made above, I have developed a success criteria of my own.  Furthermore, below is a list of the elements in my website that I would desire in order to relinquish success……
#1 - < canvas > made map, in which the user can scroll their mouse over any country and see the data based on the county provided by the WHO
Explination #1 - I believe that by incorporating this element of design, I can encourage user interaction withing my sites and have the user stay longer on the sites
#2 - In relation to the idea above
