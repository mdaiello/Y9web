	<h2><center>Success Criteria</h2></center>
    <p>Need For a solution:  After a continuous range of research, I have concluded that turning tabular data into a clean cut and a creative format is a user-friendly approach to formulating research and evaluating data.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
After doing some research, according to Avatar New York, some of the elements that make a webpage interactive and a success include…
“Updating content regularly” :  This means that every time that the World Health Organization updates their page and there is new data, my page will be updated because it is synced with the World Health Organization and observing the data every day </li>

<li> “Encouraging user interactions”: To incorporate this into my site, I will make included the map with the data appearing in on the selected country so that the user will be able to interact with my site and stay on the site for a sustained amount of time </li>

<p> As another part of my research, I have analyzed the similar design of sites like the CNN, BBC, and the Finacial Post, which are all very popular and distinguished websites, and made some conclusions regarding similarities </p>

</ul>

<ul>

	<li>Similarity #1 - Navigation Bar:  In all of these websites, there is a navigation bar across the top with a variety of menus and places of access to the site.  I would incorporate this in my site by using, CSS and making the colour a dodger blue </li>

<li>Similarity #2 - Sticky Social Bar:  Although there is a bit of variety of this element in these sites, there is always a social media bar made by using CSS.  I will incorporate this in my site, by including the World Health Organization profiles as well as my GitHub profile listed on the side of my homepage.  This will give more power to the user and provide them with more information regarding the data of the site and the code behind it</li>

<li>Similarity #3 - Delivering Information is a column like a format: Lastly, Regarding this element there is diversity, but the use of the column format delivers the information in a clean and effective way.  In order to incorporate this in my site, I will provide any textual information in that format.</li>

	</ul>

	<hi><center><font color="blue">Why did I choose my design? </h1></center>
		<p>In order to have an unbiased opinion, I decided to let my classmates help me decide which design I would use.  Furthermore, I sent out a google survey amongst my classmates and received a total of 25 responses.  The design that was chosen favourably amidst the 3 other chooses was the 2nd option, which was the map.  I was really pleased that this happened, because I believe that the use of a map to display data based on countries is very creative and interactive for the user.  The image below is a picture of the results of my survey </p>

		
		<p> Aside from the Google survey I sent out, I decided to do option 2, which was the map, in order to take on a challenge and learn new things, aside from doing the status quo, and expand my programming skills. </p>
		
<hi><center><font color="blue">Justification of Design </h1></center>		
	
	<p> 
Overall Justification: The main goal and reasoning behind said product and the aspects of design in the webpage, is to create a clean cut, creative, and user interactive webpage that transforms tabular data.
	</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>For the background of the page, I have decided to make it white, because I want the map, the specialized search, the compare button, and the title to all standout, bringing meaning and creativity to my webpage </li>
		<li>In terms of the map, I decided to include the world map, to not make an un-bais and subjective webpage, that only focuses on a specific part of the world.  Also, I had chosen to make a world map, in order to give the user a variety of countries and data to look from </li>
		<li>I have included the specialized search, for the young users, as well as first time user to have a quick way to search for what they want. </li>
		<li>Like all websites, there is a competitive advantage at play.  According to Bob Johnson Consulting, out of the 8 things he looks at in a website, he said that “ Relevance of content to audience tasks”, as well as “Ability to find and complete top tasks”.  These are all things that were taken into account when completing my webpage.  I have decided to include the comparison feature in order to have the user engaged with my site and using it for their wanted tasks</li>
		<li>I have decided to have a Developer Id, area in the top left of my page in order to provide background to my webpage and let the user access my GitHub site and look at the code behind the site </li>
		<li>Lastly, I have decided to include the raw data section in my navigation bar, so the user can source the raw data for their own use </li>
	</ul> 
<hi><center><font color="blue">Steps to Success </h1></center>		
		
<ul>
	<h2>Step #1: Setting up the structure of my website</h2>

<li>Justification and Background:  At this point in time, I will not be using any CSS or Javascript just simply beginning to build my webpage.  I will start by writing down tags such as "html" as well as an end tag “html".  I will then save my work and upload it to GitHub in my repository. This will allow me to have a blank webpage </li>
	<li>
		<h2> Step #2: Beginning to make the title at the top of the page </h2>
Justification and Requirements: In the image below it shows the design for the title in my page.  The colour of the title will be a mix of Dodger blue and facebook blue.  The colour code for this colour is #334CCF.  I decided to choose this colour because from an end-user perspective it is very appealing and creative.  The font of this title will be Times, New Roman. I have chosen this font because it is a regular font and it will not be hard to read.  In order to complete this, I must use the different HTML tags, such as “h1” and “/h1”, as well using geometric orientation within my page
 </li>

	<h2>Step #3: Create the Navigation Bar</h2>

<li>Justification and Requirements: In the image below, along with my title is a navigation bar.  The colour of the navigation bar will be white.  I have chosen this colour to make the other aspects of my website stand out. For this, I must use CSS and I have done research using sources such as W3Schools, and learned how to incorporate CSS, and found out how to use “ul”, “list-style-type”, “float”, “margin”, “padding”, as well as “overflow”. </li>
	
	<h2>Step #4: Create the map </h2>

	<li> Justification and Requirements: In the image below, the map is hand drawn.  After some research, there are some sites that use this element of design and thus, I can learn from them and make mine better.  For this to happen, I must understand the “canvas” tag, and use it to create a map, displaying data.  I will also need to use both CSS and Javascript in order to control the display of the map and the functionality</li>

		<h2>Step #5: Specialized Search </h2>
		
	<li> Justification and Requirements: In the image below, there is a specialized search, in which the user can input a name of a country, and their year, press enter and have their data be presented.  In order to do this, I will need to use Javascript in order to control the behavioural aspect of my page and furthermore, use HTML to make it structured</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h1> Vocabulary List </h2>
	
	<ul>
		<li> HTML - HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup language and controls the structure of a webpage</li>
		<li>CSS - CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet, and is used to design and add creativity to a webpage </li>
		<li>Javascript - Javascript is another programming language, that is used to control the functionality and behaviour of the webpage </li>
		<li>“canvas” - “canvas”, is an HTML tag used to display tabular data in creative formats </li>
