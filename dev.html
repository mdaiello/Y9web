    <h2>Success Criteria</h2>
    <p>Need For a solution:  After a continuous range of research, I have concluded that turning tabular data into a clean cut and a creative format is a user-friendly approach to formulating research and evaluating data.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
After doing some research, according to Avatar New York, some of the elements that make a webpage interactive and a success include…
“Updating content regularly” :  This means that every time that the World Health Organization updates their page and there is new data, my page will be updated because it is synced with the World Health Organization and observing the data every day </li>

<li> “Encouraging user interactions”: To incorporate this into my site, I will make included the map with the data appearing in on the selected country so that the user will be able to interact with my site and stay on the site for a sustained amount of time </li>

<p> As another part of my research, I have analyzed the similar design of sites like the CNN, BBC, and the Finacial Post, which are all very popular and distinguished websites, and made some conclusions regarding similarities </p>

</ul>

<ul>

	<li>Similarity #1 - Navigation Bar:  In all of these websites, there is a navigation bar across the top with a variety of menus and places of access to the site.  I would incorporate this in my site by using, CSS and making the colour a dodger blue </li>

<li>Similarity #2 - Sticky Social Bar:  Although there is a bit of variety of this element in these sites, there is always a social media bar made by using CSS.  I will incorporate this in my site, by including the World Health Organization profiles as well as my GitHub profile listed on the side of my homepage.  This will give more power to the user and provide them with more information regarding the data of the site and the code behind it</li>

<li>Similarity #3 - Delivering Information is a column like a format: Lastly, Regarding this element there is diversity, but the use of the column format delivers the information in a clean and effective way.  In order to incorporate this in my site, I will provide any textual information in that format.</li>
