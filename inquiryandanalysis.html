<hr>

<body>
	<center><p> Finace as well as data management is a key factor is today's society.  The world revolves on money and is structured to the way in which it is delivered and shown.  I believe that the need for a solution, which gives real time data, and gives multiple years of data is needed for many different target and client audiences.  This is because many of today's gouvernments, such as the US, don't have free health care, and in order to pay for such services, it comes out of their GDP  My solution will consist of an HTML, CSS, and Javascript webpage, which will be using different tags such as attribute, to deliver data pertaining to the domestic general gouvernment health expenditure, as a percentage of the GDP </p></center>

<h1> Research </h1>

<p><center> Below is the research that I have conducted pertaining to my topic, and to support my justification....</p></center>
<ul>
<li><center> According to the Atlantic, “America’s total medical costs hit a new record of $3.4 trillion, according to the federal government. That’s about 18 percent of the country’s total GDP, meaning that one out of every six dollars we spent in 2016 went to health care”</li></center>
<li><center> “The cost is so concentrated, in fact, that an estimated five percent of the population accounts for 50 percent of total medical costs”
According to Health Affaires, “he most widely used measure based on national currencies is the ratio of health to gross domestic product (GDP), which provides an indication of the percentage of total output in each country that is devoted to health spending”</li></center>
<li><center>“Our inability to measure health outcomes except in gross terms and difficulties in performing behavioral analysis limit our ability to make definitive policy assessments concerning comparative health expenditure performance” </li></center> 
<li><center> According to the World Health Organization, “Total global expenditure for health1	US$ 6.5 trillion ,Total global expenditure for health per person per year	US$ 948” </li></center>
