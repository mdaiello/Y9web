<h1><center><font color="purple"> Explanation and Justification</h1></center> 

<body> 
	<center><p>
Money and data is everywhere.  The world revolves around finance and presentation of financial data.  Many countries such as the US have spent a significant amount of money as a percentage of their GDP, in for the countries health and the predominant health expenses.  Health expenditure as a percentage of the GDP is becoming a more prevalent theme in today’s world and according to Health Affairs, “For the third consecutive year, national health spending has outpaced economic growth”, meaning that as time goes countries are spending more than their economy can handle.  Due to this re occurring problem, I believe that a solution is needed in order to portray data for government officials to analyze to find the solution to their economic problem and reduce their amount spending, pertaining to their countries health expenditure.

<h1><center><font color="purple"> Target Audience and Clientel </h1></center>
<hr>

<body>
	<center><p>
There are many different targets audiences that I want to build my solution around.  The first target audience is government officials.  Government officials are the ones who implement these policies and can use my solution to analyze their countries health expenditure in order to find solutions of their own.  My second target audience is for physicians, specifically in places where health care is not “free”, such as the United States.  For example, according to Forbes, Who's To Blame For Our Rising Healthcare Costs?, “For many years and in countless articles, physicians have been the scapegoat for rising healthcare costs in the U.S. In fact, they have been blamed by many critics for the U.S. leading the world in healthcare expenditures.”  This is true but with the rise of technology, also stated in the same source, “Technology, administrative expenses, hospital costs, lifestyle choice and chronic disease conditions have all had greater impacts on rising overall healthcare costs than physicians.” Furthermore, I have physicians as one of my target audiences, due to them being heavily criticized and for them to use my data, and formulate their own perspectives based on the data defending themselves over accusations.  Finally, my last target audience is economists, who want to study the health expenditure problem too for solutions in order to solve this international predicament.  They can analyze my data presented in a format that is easy to access and find trends in order to see the main problems of health expenditure.

<center><h1> Research and Analyzing Products </h1></center>

<body>
	<center><p> 
As previously said, finance is a key part of today’s society, and thus there is existing products, but none of them compare to the measures that my solution can reach.  The solutions that are similar to mine are the, Our world in Data - Finacing healthcare, the World Bank on Current health expenditure (% of GDP), and the OECD on Health Spending.

<h1><center> First Product - Our world in Data - Finacing healthcare </center></h1>

<body>
	<center><p>
		Our World in Data - Financing Healthcare, is a website that provides an intuitive and simple canvas option in order to deliver data that is very user-friendly. At first glance, this site has a wonderful canvas design, that is user-friendly and attractive.  It is very creative because once the user puts their mouse on top of the lines data is provided. 
</p></center>

<body>
	<center><p>
		 The downsides to this site are that there is a limited amount of data in terms of years that problems have occurred.  For example in the image above the number of years only goes up to 1994.  This is a disadvantage for the user, because studies have shown that it takes about 2 seconds for the webpage to load or the data to come up before the user leaves, and being a technology intuitive user it was challenging to find the data for the years that I wanted to use in my site, and are relevant to today’s society.  Aside from the data portrayal, the use of canvas is evident and used for optimal user interface.  I like how the countries were shown beside their lines, and for example in the picture below, I have my mouse over the countries lines and am presented with new data, through the form of canvas.

<h2><center> Overall and Evaluation </center></h2>

<body>
	<center><p>

In terms of the data within the page, there was a good amount except for the fact that it was hard to find different years of data past the 2000s which is one of the page’s faults.  In terms of the canvas usage and data presentation, I think the site had a very good amount of tabular data portrayal in an effective way.  On the contrary, the lines in the graphs can be a bit confusing for a first time user.  

</p></center>


<h2><center> Inspiration </center></h2>


<body>
	<center><p>
There is a lot of inspiration that I took away from this site.  I have learned new forms of tabular data portrayal, canvas usage in different forms, and ways in which users become interactive within the site.  For example in terms of the tabular data portrayal, I have learned and became interactive in learning new ways such as the line graph.  Tying into data portrayal, through this site I have learned new ways of canvas usage, and graph creation.  Lastly, in terms of learning new things in user interactiveness, I have learned that getting the user to get interactive in your site, can help you have them stay on the site for longer.  I can use this technique to better the marketing of my site. 

</p></center>


<h1> Second Product - World Bank on Current health expenditure (% of GDP) </h1>
<body>
	<center><p>
The second site that I will be analyzing that has an amazing canvas, portrayal of tabular data and user interface is the World Bank on Current health expenditure (% of GDP), which is using the tabular data from the WHO which the exact site that I am using data from.  At first glance, this site has a very detailed interface and use canvas very effectively.  In this site, there are 3 forms of canvas, and one form of tabular data, that hasn't been portrayed and transformed in a different way.  For example in order from the pictures below.  The first pictures in a graph in which you can move your mouse over one of the points it will portray data

</p></center>

<body>
	<center><p>


The second way that this site has portrayed is through the use of bar graphs.  There is a button that the user can use to scroll in in order to view different years of data.  Although this is a unique way of using canvas, it is my least favourite because it is not very intuitive and user engagement for a user.  The advantages of this canvas use are that it is another way of tabular data portrayal aside from the “boring” if you will regular table data

</p></center>

<body>
	<center><p>

The third aspect and design done with canvas on this website is a map.  This is my favourite one because it is very intuitive, get the users attention, and is very interactive for the user.  For example, I believe that simply the map and how the user has the ability to put their mouse over a specific of the map and be able to view the data from that country.  As mentioned from before, this part of the website also has a button to use in order to scroll and find the year of choice and to view that data.

<h2> Overall thoughts and Evaluation </h2>

<body>
	<center><p>

In terms of canvas and data portrayal, I believe that this site did an excellent job of using canvas to deliver tabular data.  The site had a very intuitive and attractive design, as well as a very effective user interface

</p></center>

<h2> Inspiration </h2>


<body>
	<center><p>
After viewing this site I have attained a lot of new inspiration that I can forward into my own site.  For example, I have learned new methods of canvas usage, as well as data portrayal.  The new canvas example that I have learned is the map and similar to the previous site, the bar with the button that the user can scroll through the years.  Overall, I will use such finding in order to benefit my site and create an amazing canvas. 


</p></center>


<h1> Third Product - OECD site on Health Spending </h1>

<body>
	<center><p>
The last site that I will be analyzing is the OECD site on Health Spending.  At first glance, this site incorporates some of the things that I want to do on my site. It gives a brief context of the topic and then provides a canvas done graph in which the user can put their mouse on top of the countries and see the data referring to their health expenditure 

</p></center>


<center><img src="joe7.png"></center>




<body>
	<center><p>

The amount of data portrayed in this site was sufficient, but the canvas aspect of the site was very crammed making it hard to read and a bit confusing coming from an end user standpoint.  Below the statistics regarding the topic, the site did branch out into a different area of health expenditure, such as hospital beds and hospital discharge rates, which were delivered in simplistic graph format without any canvas usage


</p></center>


<h2> Overall Thoughts and Evaluation </h2>

<body>
	<center><p>

Overall, the site did have a good context in terms of background information and contextuality but had minimal user engagement and interface.  


</p></center>

<h2> Inspiration</h2>

<body>
	<center><p>


Furthermore, this site had minimal inspiration towards my end goal but gave me a few ideas in different fields.  For example, this site gave me ideas towards giving contextuality and background to my topic, and how to not structure my canvas so tight making it confusing for the reader


</p></center>


<h1> Design Brief </h1>

<ul>

	<il>My site will both a canvas used and tabular data portrayal.</il> 
<li>#1 Explanation - My reasoning for having both tabular and canvas used data portrayal is to provide comfort and multiple sources of data.  Coming from the end user standpoint, I like to have multiple forms of data because it makes me feel more comfortable and makes me want to stay on the site for extended periods of time.  Also, my target audiences, such as physicians will be able to have multiple data sources to help them form conclusions and better their understanding of the problem and it solution
</il>

<li>My site will have a clean cut look, that is formulated with pictures, and has a decorative scene</li>
<li>#2 Explanation - Coming from an end user standpoint, I want the sites that I visit to be well put together, and catch my eye when I look at them.  For example sites like Facebook have very neat and clean cut layouts and that is why millions of people use their site every day.  Also, in relation to my target audience, I believe that by having a clean cut and a neat website, the site would be taken more seriously and become appealing to the users, such as government officials
</li>

<li>
	My site will include at least 4 variations of canvas designed data portrayal ( bar graph, map, line graph, as well as money emoji’s with a specific scale allowed with them.)</li>
<li>#3 Explanation - I believe that through the use of having multiple accounts of canvas, my site will become more user-friendly, for target audiences like economists and students, so that they are attracted to my site.  Also, I will be careful to not overload my site with design, so that I don’t throw off or confuse first time users.
</li>

<li>
	</li>Lastly, my site will include different sources of background information and engaging context for the reader<li>
#4 - Explanation - I  believe that by including a brief description on what health expenditure is, will truly benefit the reader, and reach the learners part of my target audience because I want my users to know what’s going on before they look at just data
</li>
</ul>

<h1> Research Plan </h1>

<ul>

<li>In order to complete my final product…. I will need to know these skills </li>


<li>HTML5, but more specifically the cavas tag in order to present my data in a creative and user-friendly way</li>
<li>Data wrangling, in order to transform a JSON file containing data, and then use that data within my site</li>
<li>CSS, in order to create the style and look of my website (ie. layout, font, and colour)</li>
<li>Javascript, in order to control the behavioural aspects of the site, and create a creative end-user experience</li>
<li>Throughout the course of my research, I have been learning about the sites that people like and what makes those sites so appreciated</li>
<li>Image Resizing and Effects, for optimal use of a layout and customization of my page</li>
<li>SEO will benefit me in the by understanding what it is, and using it to create a faster webpage (ie. 301 and 302 redirects)</li>
<li>Lastly, the last skill which I could use in my site is PHP.  PHP stands for Hypertext Preprocessor, and I think that I can use that to collect different ranges of data, and possibly compare them</li>
